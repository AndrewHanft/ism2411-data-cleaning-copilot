# Reflection

GitHub Copilot was used in writing Python functions to clean a messy sales dataset in this project. I requested Copilot to create the functions of loading data and cleaning up column names. I entered brief remarks on top of each function to give an idea of what that function was supposed to be doing, and I typed the beginning of the function. Copilot next handed me the entire body of functions which I examined, and then retained. This style of Copilot saves time and provides a good base to a solid code. I was able to concentrate on the functions because I still modified them to fit the assignment.

Having analyzed the code of Copilot, I changed it to reflect project standards. In the case of clean column names, I altered the string operations and consistently used `str.lower` and `str.replace` to ensure that the name of columns were identical and there were no errors. In `load_data`, I removed one additional print statement that Copilot included, and thus, the only thing that the `load_data` function does is to load the data. I also inserted some `strip_whitespace` and `remove_invalid_rows` functions to eliminate additional spaces in the text columns and delete the rows with negative prices or quantities, respectively. These amendments ensured that the data would be clean, correct, and ready to analyze. The repair of the proposals of Copilot demonstrated the importance of human review of AI assistance.

The project also involved the fixing of missing values. Copilot proposed the deletion of rows which lacked important information. I considered other alternatives such as replacing missing values with default options, yet I chose to eliminate them in order to keep the data dependable. I also ran a test of the cleaned dataset to ensure that no negative figures or prices were left in, as well as that all the text fields were normalized. This helped me to consider every cleaning procedure and to be accurate but complete. Minor decisions in the field of cleaning can significantly influence subsequent analysis. This section of the project assisted me in learning more about the best practices of data preparation.

The completion of this project enhanced my technical and problem-solving skills. I received practical exposure to the use of Python and pandas to transform data, work with missing data, and filter incorrect rows. Experience with Copilot taught me that AI can accelerate the coding process, but it also demonstrated its weaknesses and the importance of comprehensive re-evaluation. With the help of AI and careful editing, I got a clean and professional dataset and a properly structured Python script. The project provided me with a better workflow to use in data-cleaning tasks in the future and made me more confident in responsible use of AI in programming. My coding and data preparation foundation has been strengthened.
